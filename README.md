The general structure is intentionally free-form, to allow participants to self-organize.
We will begin each day with a period for planning, checking in, and requesting assistance from the whole group.

We strongly encourage taking walks and coffee breaks as needed, and space can be found for smaller discussions.

## Agenda

We are using a [collaboratively edited agenda](https://hackmd.io/@NiPreps-technical-monitoring/NiHack2025)
on the HackMD platform.
Please use this to propose projects or points of discussion.
Projects are welcome to link to GitHub issues or discussions,
if that is a more convenient way to organize work.

## Lodging and Logistics

All in-person participants should receive instructions to set up an account
that will allow us to book their flights and hotels, if needed.
Please contact Oscar Esteban or Chris Markiewicz if you have any questions.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nipreps/202504-sprint/issues)
